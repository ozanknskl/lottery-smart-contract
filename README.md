# lottery-smart-contract

One lottery runs for a period of 40000 blocks. A new lottery round starts right after the previous one is completed. Lottery tickets are offered in three forms:
- A full ticket which costs 8 finneys,
- A half ticket which costs 4 finneys,
- A quarter ticket which costs 2 finneys.

Three unique winners will be selected by computing random numbers that determine each winner.Three random numbers are to be supplied by the ticker purchasers.

The stages of each lottery round are scheduled as follows:

a) Ticket purchase and random number submission stage : blocks 0..19999.

b) Random number reveal stage : blocks 20000â€¦39999. Note that if previously submitted random numbers are not submitted correctly in the reveal stage, the chance of winning is lost. Also, no ticket refund is made.
